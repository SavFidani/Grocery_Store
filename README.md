## Team Communication Policy

In order to ensure this project is completed in a timely, efficient and collaborative manner our team has agreed that we will touch base on our weekly progress every Monday and Wednesday at the start of our collaboration time. Every member is to come to class prepared to update the remainder of the group on their progress for their contribution to the respective weekly deliverable. 

If we feel a need for extra collaboration time outside of our lecture hours, Saturdays at 2:00pm will pose as an additional work period.

If any group member feels as through they are unable to complete their work for the week, we ask that they notify the remainder of us by Thursday night so that we can do our best to support them in a timely manner. All rough work/individual submission components are to be completed and uploaded into GitHub by Saturday night so they are ready for a Sunday morning review, push and approval.
